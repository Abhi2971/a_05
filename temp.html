            <h2> Energy: Explanation </h2>
                    <p class="para2">
                        <strong> What is Energy? </strong>
                        Energy is a fundamental concept in physics and is often defined as the ability to do work or the capacity for action.
                        It exists in various forms, such as kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), 
                        thermal energy (heat), chemical energy (energy stored in chemical bonds), electrical energy (energy carried by electrons), and many others. Energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
                        <strong> Forms of Energy: </strong><br><br>
                        <strong> Kinetic Energy: </strong> This is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object depends on its mass (m) and its velocity (v) according to the equation KE = 0.5 * m * v^2.<br><br>
                        <strong> Potential Energy: </strong> This is the energy possessed by an object due to its position or configuration relative to other objects. It can take various forms such as gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, chemical potential energy, etc.<br><br>
                        <strong> Thermal Energy: </strong> This is the internal energy of a system due to the random motion of its particles. It's related to the temperature of the system and represents the sum of the kinetic energies of its particles.<br><br>
                        <strong> Chemical Energy: </strong> This is the energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds. It's released or absorbed during chemical reactions.<br><br>
                        <strong> Electrical Energy: </strong> This is the energy associated with the movement of electrons through a conductor, typically in the form of an electric current.<br><br>
                       <strong> Nuclear Energy: </strong> This is the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. It can be released through nuclear reactions such as fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) or fusion (merging of atomic nuclei).<br>
