                            <strong> Definition: </strong>
                            Energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Work, in physics, is the transfer of energy from one object to another, 
                            typically by the application of force over a distance.<br><br>
                            <strong> Conservation of Energy:</strong>The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In a closed system,
                            the total energy remains constant over time.<br><br>
                            <strong> Units of Energy:</strong>Energy is measured in various units, depending on the form of energy being considered. Some common units include joules (J), calories (cal), kilowatt-hours (kWh), and electronvolts (eV).<br><br>
                            <strong>Importance of Energy:</strong>Energy is essential for all aspects of life and is a fundamental concept in physics. It powers our homes, fuels transportation, drives technological advancements, and sustains biological processes. 
                            Understanding energy and its various forms is crucial for addressing challenges such as climate change, energy security,
                            and sustainable development.<br><br>

                                        <strong> What is Energy? </strong>
                                        Energy is a fundamental concept in physics and is often defined as the ability to do work or the capacity for action.
                                        It exists in various forms, such as kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), 
                                        thermal energy (heat), chemical energy (energy stored in chemical bonds), electrical energy (energy carried by electrons), and many others. Energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
                                        <strong> Forms of Energy: </strong><br><br>
                                        <strong> Kinetic Energy: </strong> This is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object depends on its mass (m) and its velocity (v) according to the equation KE = 0.5 * m * v^2.<br><br>
                                        <strong> Potential Energy: </strong> This is the energy possessed by an object due to its position or configuration relative to other objects. It can take various forms such as gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, chemical potential energy, etc.<br><br>
                                        <strong> Thermal Energy: </strong> This is the internal energy of a system due to the random motion of its particles. It's related to the temperature of the system and represents the sum of the kinetic energies of its particles.<br><br>
                                        <strong> Chemical Energy: </strong> This is the energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds. It's released or absorbed during chemical reactions.<br><br>
                                        <strong> Electrical Energy: </strong> This is the energy associated with the movement of electrons through a conductor, typically in the form of an electric current.<br><br>
                                    <strong> Nuclear Energy: </strong> This is the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. It can be released through nuclear reactions such as fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) or fusion (merging of atomic nuclei).<br>
